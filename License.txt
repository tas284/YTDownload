Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any software library or other program which is
  licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library's
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give
  any other recipients of the library a copy of this License along with the
  library.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it,
  and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
    b) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
    c) You must license the entire library, as modified, under this License
    to all third parties, including those to whom you distribute the library.
    
    d) You must make sure that the library is not linked to proprietary
    programs that are not free.

  3. You may copy and distribute the library (or a portion of it, under
  the terms of this License) in object code or executable form under the
  terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
  under the terms of this License.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the library
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
  copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the library is void, and will
  automatically terminate your rights under this License.

  5. This License is not intended to limit the licensing of the library to
  only free software. However, you are not allowed to impose any
  additional restrictions beyond what is stated in this License.

  6. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
  detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a
  distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number
  of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Library does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  7. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.
